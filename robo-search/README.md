# Mini-Project - Robo-Friends Search

### Project Description
This is a learn project created as a part of DI-Bootcamp course. I had to create a robot website allowing to use a searchbar with Advanced Javascript. The cards are displayed in the DOM, using DOM elements and selectors, and filtered with the search box.

#### PART I : The Website
The webpage displays Cards of Robots with their respective image and information. The cards must contain the values from the array of objects provided.

#### PART II : The Filter
When you search for a specific name in the search box, the webpage filters the cards displayed. For example is you write “nic” in the search box, you will display the robot which name contains “nic”, which means only one robot: “Nicholas”.
