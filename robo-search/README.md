A Robo-Friends Search with Advanced Javascript

In this project you will have to create a robot website

PART I : The Website
The webpage displays Cards of Robots with their respective image and information.

PART II : The Filter
When you search for a specific name in the search box, the webpage filters the cards displayed. For example is you write “nic” in the search box, you will display the robot which name contains “nic”, which means only one robot: “Nicholas”.
