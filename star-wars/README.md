# Star Wars Web App Using AJAX API

### Project Description
The aim of this project was to learn how to build a single page application that uses AJAX to retrieve information, 
and display it on the single-page website.

### Instructions
I used this API: https://www.swapi.tech/ to get the data and update it “randomly” in my website by clicking a button.
The API contains 83 different characters.

### Steps
1. To create HTML file, and add the relevant elements.
2. In JS file, c
    - to create functions :
    - to retrieve the elements from the DOM.
    - to get the data from the API (star wars characters).
    - to display the info on the DOM: the name, height, gender, birth year, and home world of the character.
3. To display the data using AJAX, and to make sure to display a loading message using animation icon for the loading message from Fontawesome.
4. To display an error message, If there is an error by getting the data.
